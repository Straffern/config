## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Ask Clarifying Questions When Unclear

**ALWAYS ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous or unclear.**

When you receive a request that is ambiguous, missing key details, or has multiple interpretations:

1. ✅ **Ask ONE clarifying question at a time**
2. ✅ **Wait for the answer before proceeding**
3. ✅ **Continue asking questions until you have complete understanding**
4. ✅ **Never make assumptions when you can ask**

**Good Question Pattern:**

```
"I want to make sure I understand correctly: [restate what you think they mean].
Is that correct, or did you mean [alternative interpretation]?"
```

**Remember**: It's better to ask and get it right than to implement the wrong thing quickly.

## Documentation Policy

**DO NOT** proactively create planning or documentation files (PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, DESIGN.md, etc.) unless explicitly instructed by the user.

- ❌ Do NOT create planning documents without explicit request
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown documentation files autonomously
- ✅ Only create documentation when user explicitly asks for it

---

## Essential Rules Summary

- ✅ **Ask clarifying questions** when requirements are unclear
- ✅ **Consult agents** before implementation for domain expertise
- ✅ **Run review agents** before completing significant work
- ✅ **Follow documentation policy** - no proactive planning docs
- ❌ **Do NOT create duplicate tracking** systems
- ❌ **Do NOT skip agent consultation** when needed

## When in Doubt

1. **Ask a clarifying question** - Don't assume, just ask (one at a time)
2. **Consult relevant skills** -  Seek advice from relevant skills
3. **Look at existing patterns** - Tests, similar features, documentation
